# Workflow / Process and User Story
1. Went over a power point that outlines how the business functions and what the vision is for the IT infrastructure
    - FIELDS - Fields Ion Pairs/Hydrogen Bonds Electrostatics Linear Free-Energy
    - Basically figure out how well these compounds are going to bind
    - We have 4520 unique novel fragments and scaffolds with proprietary RO3 criteria coupled with empirical data
    - Need similarity scores of a protein that we don't have to ones that we do (120). We then could say there is a more likely change that these similar compounds will work.
2. Jake said he would send me some papers about some technologies etc. that others are doing that are relevant to our stuff.
