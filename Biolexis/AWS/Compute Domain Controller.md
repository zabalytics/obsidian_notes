Source [varonis.com](https://www.varonis.com/blog/domain-controller)

A domain controller is a server that responds to authentication requests and verifies users on computer networks. Domains are a hierarchical way of organizing users and computers that work together on the same network. The domain controller keeps all of that data organized and secure.

Basically, the domain controller holds the keys to the entire network. An example of this is Microsoft's active directory service, which enables admins to manage permissions and access to network resources.
